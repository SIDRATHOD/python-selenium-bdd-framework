### Cursor Collaboration Rules

Operating principles for planning and implementation within Cursor:

1. PRD Alignment
- All tasks must trace back to `docs/PRD-AI-Self-Healing-Locators.md` acceptance criteria.

2. Non-Coding in Planning Docs
- These files are planning-only; no executable code.

3. Edit Hygiene
- Make minimal, targeted edits; preserve formatting and file structure.
- Restrict any future code edits to whitelisted directories (`pages/`, `features/steps/`).

4. Observability and Audit
- Maintain structured logs and ensure `healing_report.json` schema is respected.

5. Safety and Review
- Prefer manual mode for first adoption; enable auto mode only after baselining accuracy.

6. Communication
- Summarize changes succinctly; use bullets, headings, and links to files.
