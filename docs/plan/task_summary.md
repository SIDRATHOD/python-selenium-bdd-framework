### Task Summary

This plan sequences five tasks aligned to the PRD:

1. Error Detection and Artifact Capture
2. AI Error Analysis and Candidate Generation
3. Code Auto-Fix (Targeted Locator Edit)
4. Re-run and Validation
5. Audit and Governance
Flow:
- Detect failure → capture artifacts → analyze with AI → apply minimal fix → re-run with retries → record outcomes → govern via config and reports.

Risk Controls:
- Stability scoring, selector preference order, AST-targeted edits, manual mode.

Completion Definition:
- Healing accuracy ≥80%, reduced maintenance time ≥60%, zero false positives on truly missing elements and comprehensive reports.
